the indie scene is incredibly vast.

    If you like management sims, look at factorio or satisfactory.

    if you enjoy metroidvania check out "Hollow knight", "Ori and the blind forest/ori and the will of the whisps", "Ender Lillies"

    if you like deck-builders have a look at "slay the spire", "Loop Hero"

    if you like action rouge-likes look at Hades, Dead Cells, BPM, Noita, Binding of Isaac, Rouge legacy and "have a nice death"

    Strategy and management games are "AI-War" 1 and 2, Halcion 6, Convoy, FTL, Prision architect, Rimworld, Rise to Ruins, Dwarf fortress

that only scratches the surface.

## not my genre.

Here is what i have played:

    Va-11 Hall-A: cyberpunk Bartender Action: live through your workdaysw as a bartender, mxing drinks and helping out your fellow doomed inhabitants of this dystopia by lending an ear and caring for their souls.

    soma (the masterpiece by the devs of Amnesia the Dark descent. asks the dreaded question: what is it to be alive? what makes you alive? what makes a life worth anything? Depending on your stance on the issue (or if you dont already have one) this can be VERY disturbing, but overasll still fun Horror game)

    The longing. Still havent finished that one (ill wait till i get to be 50 years of age and do a vacation in some winter hideout with nothing but a roaring fire and my comupter to keep me company). A game based on the concept of waiting and enjoying the wait and appreciating the things that come to be over time.

    graveyard keeper: relaxing management sim where you lay people to rest and slowely explore what happened in this world... and to your wife. Simple but relaxing.

    Gemeni Rue: classic Point and click i played a few years back. remember it was interesting.

    Sense: Big tiddy Cyberpunk-lady has to face spooky ghosts. Feels and plays like the original Clocktower on SNES.

but here is what i hear is good

    to the moon (basically became a classic)

    roadwarden (an honest to god old-school Text adventure, but with nice pixel art)

    the longest journey + Dreamfall -> 20yr old Point and click, but supposedly one of the best

    VirtuaVerse. Cyberpunk, old-school. point and click.

    Disco Elysium has hardened Communists as its developers, but they DID make a good game that has been praised by multiple people, even on our side of the culture war.

    want atmospheric walking sims? appearantly there is "Ghost on the shore"

    Justice.exe is a legal drama, where you need to defend a sentient AI in court from supercorporations of a dystopian future. Still EA, though

    want something cute and simple, yet "emotional" ? I hear good things about Chicory: A Colorful Tale

    The Brotherhood franchise are a bunch on isometric horror point and clicks. Got many of them in my library, but hadnt time yet to play them. have a nice style and premise, though. Are also very cheap.

if you find something really interesting let me know.
