the indie scene is incredibly vast.

    If you like management sims, look at factorio or satisfactory.

    if you enjoy metroidvania check out "Hollow knight", "Ori and the blind forest/ori and the will of the whisps", "Ender Lillies"

    if you like deck-builders have a look at "slay the spire", "Loop Hero"

    if you like action rouge-likes look at Hades, Dead Cells, BPM, Noita, Binding of Isaac, Rouge legacy and "have a nice death"

    Strategy and management games are "AI-War" 1 and 2, Halcion 6, Convoy, FTL, Prision architect, Rimworld, Rise to Ruins, Dwarf fortress

that only scratches the surface.
